.. About LIAM2 ..
.. =========== ..

LIAM2 is a tool to develop (different kinds of) :ref:`microsimulation
<microsimulation>` models.

The goal of the project is to let modellers concentrate on what is strictly
specific to their model without having to worry about the technical details.
This is achieved by providing a generic microsimulation toolbox which is not
tied to a particular model. By making it available for free, our hope is to
greatly reduce the development costs (in terms of both time and money) of
microsimulation models.

The toolbox is made as generic as possible so that it can be used to develop
almost any microsimulation model as long as it uses cross-sectional ageing, ie
all individuals are simulated at the same time for one period, then for the next
period, etc.
